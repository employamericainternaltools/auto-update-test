Name,Description
Imports,Imports represent the value of goods brought into the United States from foreign countries.
Exports,"Exports represent the value of goods shipped out of the United States to foreign destinations. The Census Bureau defines exports as the total physical movement of merchandise out of the United States to foreign countries, whether such merchandise is exported from within U.S. Customs territory or from a U.S. Customs bonded warehouse or Foreign Trade Zone."
Trade Balance,"The merchandise trade balance represents the difference between U.S. exports and U.S. general imports. This balance corresponds to a measurement of the international payments or credit flows resulting from the physical movement of goods between the U.S. and foreign countries. A positive balance (surplus) occurs when exports exceed imports, while a negative balance (deficit) occurs when imports exceed exports."
PPI-Adjusted Imports,"PPI-Adjusted Imports represent import values adjusted using the Producer Price Index rather than the Import Price Index. The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. When imports are adjusted using the PPI, it allows for comparison between foreign imports and domestic production on a more equivalent price basis."
IPI-Adjusted Imports,"IPI-Adjusted Imports represent the value of imports adjusted for price changes using the Import Price Index. The Import Price Index (IPI) measures changes in prices of goods purchased from other countries by the United States. By adjusting import values with the IPI, analysts can estimate real changes in import volumes by removing the effects of price inflation or deflation. This adjustment helps determine whether increases or decreases in import values reflect changes in actual quantities of goods traded or merely changes in their prices."
PPI-Adjusted Exports,"PPI-Adjusted Exports represent export values adjusted using the Producer Price Index rather than the Export Price Index. This adjustment provides an alternative perspective by comparing exports to domestic production on a consistent price basis. When exports are adjusted using the PPI instead of the EPI, the resulting measurements can help analyze how domestic production is distributed between serving foreign markets versus domestic consumption. "
EPI-Adjusted Exports,"EPI-Adjusted Exports represent the value of exports adjusted for price changes using the Export Price Index. The Export Price Index (EPI) measures price changes of goods sold to foreign buyers by U.S. residents. By adjusting export values with the EPI, analysts can estimate real changes in export volumes by removing the effects of price inflation or deflation. This adjustment helps determine whether increases or decreases in export values reflect changes in actual quantities of goods traded or merely changes in their prices."
Industrial Production,"The Federal Reserve's monthly index of industrial production measures the real output of all relevant establishments located in the United States, regardless of their ownership, but not those located in U.S. territories. It covers manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities - sectors that, together with construction, account for the federalreserve bulk of variation in national output over business cycles.
This production index measures real output expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year (currently 2017). Since 1972, the indexes have been computed as Fisher indexes with weights based on annual estimates of value added. The index tracks physical output rather than sales or revenue, making it a key measure of actual industrial activity."
Capacity Utilization,"The rate of capacity utilization equals the seasonally adjusted output index expressed as a percentage of the related capacity index. In simpler terms, capacity utilization measures how much of the economy's potential output is actually being used. It shows the relationship between actual production and what could be produced if all available resources were fully employed. When this rate is high, it indicates the industrial sector is operating near its full capability, while lower rates suggest unused capacity."
Capacity,"The capacity index is an estimate of sustainable potential output, also expressed as a percentage of actual output in 2017. This measure represents the maximum level of output an industry can maintain within a realistic work schedule, accounting for normal downtime and assuming sufficient inputs to operate machinery and equipment. It's not the absolute physical maximum possible output, but rather the highest level that can be sustained under normal operational conditions."
Relative Importance Weights,"These weights reflect each industry's contribution to total industrial value added. When calculating the overall industrial production index, each industry's output is weighted according to its economic importance. For example, if an industry has a relative importance weight of 4 percent and its output increases by 10 percent in a month, this would boost growth in total industrial production by 0.4 percentage points (0.04 × 10% = 0.4%). "
Import Price Index,"The Import Price Index serves as a vital economic indicator by measuring average price changes of goods and services imported into the United States. This index plays a crucial role in understanding external inflationary pressures, as it captures price movements at the earliest point of entry into the domestic economy. Rising import prices often signal potential domestic inflation, while falling prices may indicate deflationary global conditions or strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The Bureau of Economic Analysis relies on this index to calculate real GDP by deflating the import component of net exports, ensuring accurate measurement of economic growth adjusted for price changes. Policymakers, economists, and businesses analyze import price trends to assess international competitiveness, evaluate exchange rate pass-through effects, understand terms of trade dynamics, and forecast inflationary pressures. The index covers nearly all merchandise imports and select services, organized by both commodity and industry classifications, providing comprehensive insights into how international price movements affect the U.S. economy."
Export Price Index,"The Export Price Index functions as a key economic indicator by tracking average price changes of goods and services exported from the United States to foreign markets. This index offers unique insights into U.S. competitive position in global markets, as rising export prices may indicate strong international demand for American products or potential loss of price competitiveness, while falling prices might suggest weakening global demand or improved cost efficiency among U.S. producers. Like its import counterpart, the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses this index to calculate real GDP by deflating the export component of net exports. The Export Price Index also serves as an essential tool for analyzing terms of trade (the ratio of export to import prices), which indicates whether a country's economic welfare from international trade is improving or deteriorating over time. Policymakers and businesses carefully monitor export price trends to evaluate exchange rate effects on trade volumes, assess industry competitiveness, negotiate international trade agreements, and develop export marketing strategies for different world regions."
Producer Price Index,"The Producer Price Index (PPI) functions as a crucial upstream inflation indicator by measuring average price changes received by domestic producers for their output at the first commercial transaction point. Unlike consumer-focused metrics, the PPI captures price pressures at earlier stages of production, often providing early signals of future consumer inflation trends as these costs gradually work their way through the supply chain. The index encompasses a family of measures organized by industry classification, commodity grouping, and final demand-intermediate demand systems, offering multidimensional insights into price dynamics across the economy. Businesses regularly utilize PPI data for contract adjustment, sales forecasting, and inventory valuation (LIFO), while economists and policymakers analyze these indexes to understand cost-push inflation dynamics, supply chain pressures, and industry-specific economic conditions. The PPI's ability to detect inflationary pressures before they reach consumers makes it particularly valuable for monetary policy decisions and economic forecasting."
All Employees,"All Employees is a comprehensive measure of the number of persons on nonfarm establishment payrolls who received pay for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th day of the month. This indicator represents the total count of jobs in the economy, not the number of people employed, as individuals working multiple jobs would be counted at each establishment. The data specifically excludes proprietors, the unincorporated self-employed, unpaid volunteer or family workers, farm workers, and domestic workers, while including salaried officers of corporations. This premier indicator serves as a crucial metric for evaluating the health of the U.S. labor market and is a key component of the monthly Employment Situation report, one of the earliest indicators of economic conditions released each month."
Average Weekly Hours of All Employees,"Average Weekly Hours of All Employees represents the total aggregate hours divided by the number of employees paid for those hours during the reference pay period. This measure differs from standard or scheduled hours, as it reflects actual hours paid, including overtime, but also accounts for factors like unpaid absenteeism, labor turnover, part-time work, and work stoppages that typically cause average weekly hours to be lower than scheduled hours. AWH serves as a leading economic indicator because employers often adjust employee hours before making hiring or layoff decisions. During economic downturns, this indicator typically drops as businesses reduce employee hours, while in periods of recovery, hours tend to increase before new hiring occurs, making it valuable for identifying turning points in economic cycles."
Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees,"Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees (AHE) is calculated by dividing the aggregate weekly payroll by aggregate weekly hours. This measure reflects not only changes in basic hourly and incentive wage rates but also captures variable factors such as premium pay for overtime and late-shift work. It's important to note that AHE differs from wage rates and does not measure employers' total labor costs, as it excludes benefits, irregular bonuses, retroactive items, and employer-paid payroll taxes. The indicator also reflects compositional shifts in employment between high-paid and low-paid industries or occupations. When adjusted for inflation, it provides insight into the purchasing power of workers' earnings, though it should not be used as the sole measure of changes in living standards, which are affected by many other factors."
Production and Nonsupervisory Employees,"Production and Nonsupervisory Employees (PE) is a subset of total employment that counts workers who are not primarily in supervisory roles. In manufacturing and mining, this category includes working supervisors and all nonsupervisory employees engaged in activities such as fabricating, processing, and maintenance. In construction, it includes working supervisors, craft workers, and laborers. In service-providing industries, it encompasses employees who are not above working-supervisor levels, including office and clerical workers, technicians, sales staff, and service personnel. This data series has a longer history than the All Employees series, dating back to the 1960s, making it valuable for long-term trend analysis. The PE category represents approximately 80 percent of total private employment, providing insight into wage and hour trends for rank-and-file workers."
Average Weekly Hours of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees,"Average Weekly Hours of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees represents the aggregate weekly hours worked by production and nonsupervisory employees divided by the number of such employees paid for those hours. This indicator has historically been tracked longer than the All Employees hours metric, with data available back to the 1960s for most industries. Like the broader AWH measure, it reflects actual hours paid rather than scheduled hours and captures the effects of overtime, part-time work, and labor turnover. This metric often exhibits greater sensitivity to economic changes than the All Employees counterpart because production and nonsupervisory employees typically experience more immediate adjustments to their work schedules during economic fluctuations. It's particularly useful for industry-specific analysis, as hours patterns can vary significantly across different sectors of the economy."
Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees,"Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees measures the average hourly compensation paid to production workers in goods-producing industries and nonsupervisory employees in service-providing industries. This series has been collected since the 1960s, providing one of the longest-running measures of worker compensation in the U.S. economy. The indicator is particularly valuable for analyzing wage trends among middle and lower-income workers who comprise the majority of the labor force. When compared with the broader All Employees earnings measure, it helps identify wage disparities between supervisory and nonsupervisory workers."
Women Employees,"Women Employees (WE) is a measure of the number of women on establishment payrolls who received pay for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th day of the month. This data series provides crucial information about women's representation across industries and sectors of the economy, allowing for analysis of gender-based employment patterns and trends. The WE data helps identify industries where women are underrepresented or overrepresented and can inform policies aimed at reducing gender-based occupational segregation. When analyzed alongside wage data, it contributes to understanding of gender pay differentials. The BLS began publishing this data in its current form in the early 1990s, though some historical data exists back to the 1960s for select industries."
Finished Goods Inventories,"Finished Goods Inventory represents the value of all completed products ready for shipment and all inventories and goods bought for resale requiring no further processing or assembly. No accumulation of finished goods inventories should occur with long-term contracts unless the total sales receipts are not recorded until the time of delivery. This indicator is a key component of total inventories and provides insights into manufacturers' ability to meet immediate customer demand without additional production. It's tracked monthly as part of the Census Bureau's M3 Survey and is reported at current cost or market value, representing the end-of-month stocks of fully completed products."
Inventories to Shipments Ratio,"The Inventories to Shipments Ratio is calculated by dividing the total value of manufacturers' inventories by the value of shipments for the same period. This ratio is a critical economic indicator that measures how well inventory levels align with current sales activity. A rising ratio may indicate either slowing demand or intentional inventory building, while a declining ratio might suggest either strengthening demand or deliberate inventory reduction efforts. This metric helps analysts understand whether manufacturers are carrying excess inventory relative to their current sales pace, providing insights into future production planning."
Material and Supply Inventories,"Materials-and-Supplies Inventory encompasses all unprocessed raw and semifabricated commodities and supplies for which the manufacturer has title. This indicator represents the first stage in the production process inventory chain, capturing the value of inputs that have not yet entered the manufacturing process. Material and supply inventories are closely monitored as they can signal manufacturers' expectations about future production needs and potential supply chain challenges. Changes in this metric may reflect shifts in purchasing strategies, cost fluctuations in raw materials, or adjustments in production planning cycles."
New Orders,"A new order is a communication of an intention to buy for immediate or future delivery. New orders serve as an indicator of future production commitments, and the data are direct inputs into the leading economic indicator series. New orders, as reported in the monthly M3 press release, are derived by adding shipments to the net change in the unfilled orders from the previous month. This indicator is particularly valuable as it provides insight into future manufacturing activity and business confidence."
Total Inventories,"Total inventories represent the value of the end-of-month stocks regardless of stage of fabrication (whether in the form of purchased materials and supplies, work in process, or finished goods). This comprehensive inventory measure provides a complete picture of manufacturers' inventory holdings across all stages of production. Total inventories reflect manufacturers' resource commitments and can signal adjustments in production strategies. Increases may suggest anticipation of stronger future demand or indicate potential oversupply situations, while decreases might reflect either production constraints or intentional inventory optimization efforts."
Unfilled Orders,"Generally, unfilled orders at the end of an accounting period are equal to unfilled orders at the beginning of the period, plus new orders net of cancellations received during the period, less net sales. This includes orders that have not yet passed through the sales account and funded orders (or portions of orders) for which the value of work done has not been reported as sales. Also known as order backlog, this indicator shows the volume of orders that manufacturers have committed to but have not yet fulfilled, providing insights into future production requirements and potential capacity constraints."
Unfilled Orders to Shipments Ratios,"The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments is an important indicator of pressure on manufacturing capacity. Census This metric quantifies how many months it would take to complete all existing orders at the current production pace. A higher ratio suggests increasing production backlogs and potentially longer delivery times, which might indicate strong demand, production constraints, or both. Analysts use this ratio to gauge manufacturers' ability to meet demand and to identify potential bottlenecks in supply chains or production processes."
Value of Shipments,"Manufacturers' shipments measure the dollar value of products sold by manufacturing establishments and are based on net selling values, f.o.b. (free on board) plant, after discounts and allowances are excluded. Freight charges and excise taxes are excluded. This indicator represents the actual output leaving manufacturing facilities during the reporting period, providing a direct measure of current production activity. Value of shipments data are used to calculate GDP and serve as a key indicator of current economic conditions in the manufacturing sector, with changes reflecting shifts in both production volumes and pricing."
Work in Process Inventories,"Work-in-Process Inventory represents accumulated costs of all commodities undergoing fabrication within plants and long-term contracts where the inventory costs are for undelivered items and the value of work done that has not been reported in sales. This mid-stage inventory measure reflects the value of products that have entered the production process but are not yet completed. Work-in-process inventories provide insight into the manufacturing pipeline and production efficiency. Changes in this measure can indicate shifts in production scheduling, manufacturing capacity utilization, or production flow bottlenecks."
Structures Investment (Nominal),"Structures Investment represents current-dollar expenditures by private businesses, nonprofit institutions, and households on new construction and improvements to existing structures in the U.S. economy. This investment category includes commercial and health care buildings, manufacturing facilities, power and communication structures, mining exploration, residential housing, and associated ownership transfer costs. Reported in NIPA Table 5.3.5, this nominal measure reflects actual transaction prices of the reporting period without adjustment for inflation, making it valuable for cash-flow and financing analyses. The data is primarily derived from Census Bureau construction spending surveys, with additional inputs from other government and industry sources. As a forward-looking component of GDP, structures investment serves as a key indicator of business confidence and future productive capacity in the economy (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, ""Table 5.3.5 Private Fixed Investment by Type,"" https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/)."
Structures Investment (2017 Dollars),"Structures Investment in chained (2017) dollars measures real private investment in structures, adjusted for inflation using 2017 as the reference year. Found in NIPA Table 5.3.6, this inflation-adjusted measure enables meaningful comparisons of structures investment volumes across different time periods by removing the effects of price changes. The BEA calculates real structures investment using a variety of price deflators, including the Producer Price Index (PPI) for office building construction, Census Bureau price indexes for residential construction, and specialized indexes for utilities and mining structures. This real measure is crucial for analyzing actual production capacity additions to the economy, productivity trends, and long-term economic growth potential, as it reflects physical investment activity rather than nominal spending influenced by price fluctuations (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, ""Table 5.3.6 Real Private Fixed Investment by Type, Chained Dollars,"" https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/)."
Equipment Investment (Nominal),"Equipment Investment captures current-dollar private business and nonprofit institution expenditures on new equipment and net purchases of used equipment from government, households, and foreign sources. Detailed in NIPA Table 5.3.5, this category encompasses information processing equipment, industrial equipment, transportation equipment, and other machinery with service lives exceeding one year. The BEA primarily estimates equipment investment using the commodity-flow method, which starts with manufacturers' shipments data and adjusts for imports, exports, transportation costs, trade margins, and changes in inventories. As a highly cyclical component of GDP, nominal equipment investment provides crucial insights into business conditions, technology adoption patterns, and near-term economic outlook. Its sensitivity to interest rates and tax policies also makes it an important indicator for evaluating the impacts of monetary and fiscal policy changes (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, ""Table 5.3.5 Private Fixed Investment by Type,"" https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/)."
Equipment Investment (2017 Dollars),"Equipment Investment in chained (2017) dollars represents inflation-adjusted private investment in equipment, using 2017 as the reference year. Found in NIPA Table 5.3.6, this real measure provides volume estimates of equipment investment over time by removing the effects of price changes. The BEA calculates real equipment investment primarily through deflation, using detailed Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) and Import Price Indexes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for specific equipment categories. For information technology equipment, the BEA employs quality-adjusted price indexes to account for rapid technological improvements. This real measure is particularly valuable for analyzing productivity trends, capital deepening, technological adoption rates, and potential output growth. Because equipment investment often represents technological embodiment, real equipment investment serves as a key indicator of innovation diffusion throughout the economy (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, ""Table 5.3.6 Real Private Fixed Investment by Type, Chained Dollars,"" https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/)."
