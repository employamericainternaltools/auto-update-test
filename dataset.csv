International Trade,"The U.S. Census Bureau International Trade dataset provides comprehensive statistics on imports and exports of merchandise between the United States and its international trading partners. While originally collected using Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) for imports and Schedule B classifications for exports, the data is recoded to various classification systems including the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) here, which organizes industries according to similar production processes. The dataset enables analysis of trade flows by industry sector, geographic region, and time period, serving as a crucial resource for economic analysis, policy development, and business decision-making."
Production and Capacity,"The Federal Reserve's monthly index of industrial production and the related capacity indexes and capacity utilization rates cover manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The industrial sector, together with construction, accounts for the bulk of the variation in national output over the course of the business cycle. The industrial detail provided by these measures helps illuminate structural developments in the economy."
Price Indices,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Price Indices dataset encompasses three major indicators that measure price changes across different economic sectors: the Producer Price Index (PPI), the Import Price Index, and the Export Price Index. The PPI tracks average changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, measuring inflation at the producer level before goods and services reach consumers. The Import and Export Price Indices, components of the International Price Program (IPP), measure price changes in goods and services traded between the U.S. and foreign countries, playing a critical role in calculating inflation-adjusted GDP and assessing international competitiveness. Together, these three indices provide complementary perspectives on price movements throughout the economy, serving as essential tools for economic analysis, policy formulation, contract adjustment, and forecasting. All three use similar methodological frameworks but focus on different segments of economic activity, creating a comprehensive picture of price dynamics across domestic production and international trade."
Current Employment Statistics,"The Current Employment Statistics-National (CES-N) program produces detailed industry estimates of nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings of workers on payrolls. Each month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data through the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey from businesses and government agencies for individual worksites drawn from a sampling frame of unemployment insurance tax accounts."
"M3 Manufacturers Shipments, Inventories & Orders","The M3 is based upon data reported from manufacturing establishments with $500 million or more in annual shipments. Units may be divisions of diversified large companies, large homogenous companies, or single-unit manufacturers in 89 industry categories. The M3 provides statistics on manufacturers' value of shipments, new orders (net of cancellations), end-of-month order backlog (unfilled orders), end-of-month total inventory, materials and supplies, work-in-process, and finished goods inventories (at current cost or market value)."
Investment,"Private fixed investment (PFI) measures spending by private businesses, nonprofit institutions, and households on fixed assets in the U.S. economy. Fixed assets consist of structures, equipment, and intellectual property products that are used in the production of goods and services. The PFI estimates serve as an indicator of the willingness of private businesses and nonprofit institutions to expand their production capacity and as an indicator of the demand for housing. Thus, movements in PFI serve as a barometer of confidence in, and support for, future economic growth."
