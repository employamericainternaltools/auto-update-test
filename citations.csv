International Trade,"Census International Trade data is accessible through the U.S. Census Bureau's main Foreign Trade portal (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/). For NAICS-specific trade information, users can access the NAICS Index (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/country/naics/index.html) or use USA Trade Online for detailed NAICS data (https://usatrade.census.gov/). Documentation on methodology is available through the International Trade Statistical Program description (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/guide/sec2.html), International Trade Definitions (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/definitions/index.html), and the Guide to International Trade Datasets (https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/guides/Guide_to_International_Trade_Datasets.pdf). Developers can utilize the International Trade API (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/international-trade.html) to access Monthly U.S. Exports and Imports by NAICS classification."
Production and Capacity,"For comprehensive information about the G.17 Industrial Production dataset, you can access the main G.17 page (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/) which serves as the top-level menu. For citation documentation and detailed information, refer to the explanatory notes (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/About.htm), the Data Download Program (https://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=g17), and the FRED page with citation format (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO). Technical documentation is available through resources on industrial production methodology (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/IpNotes.htm), capacity utilization methodology (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/CapNotes.htm), and source and description tables (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/SandDesc/sdtab1.pdf)."
Price Indices,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces a complementary set of key economic indicators through its Producer Price Index (PPI) and International Price Program (IPP) which includes both Import and Export Price Indices. These three major price indices work together to provide a comprehensive view of price movements throughout the U.S. economy and its international trade relationships. The PPI measures price changes from domestic producers' perspective (https://www.bls.gov/ppi/), tracking inflation pressures before they reach the consumer level, while the Import and Export Price Indices track price changes in goods and services traded between the U.S. and foreign countries (https://www.bls.gov/mxp/). All three indices share similar methodological foundations—using representative baskets of goods and services, matched-item pricing, and detailed classification systems—but focus on different economic domains. Together, they serve critical functions in economic analysis: deflating components of GDP, adjusting contracts for inflation, measuring terms of trade, analyzing exchange rate effects, assessing industrial competitiveness, and providing early signals of inflation trends. Users can access detailed methodology documentation (https://www.bls.gov/ppi/methodology-reports/methodology.htm and https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ipp/concepts.htm), download customized datasets (https://www.bls.gov/ppi/databases/ and https://www.bls.gov/mxp/data/), and view the latest releases and analyses through the BLS website, making these indices essential tools for economists, policymakers, and business analysts seeking to understand price dynamics across domestic and international markets."
Current Employment Statistics,"For comprehensive access to the Current Employment Statistics (CES) dataset, users can explore the main CES program page (https://www.bls.gov/ces/) and the dedicated CES data portal (https://www.bls.gov/ces/data/). Detailed methodological information is available in the BLS Handbook of Methods (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ces/) with specific concepts explained in the concepts documentation (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ces/concepts.htm). Technical aspects of the survey and benchmarking procedures are covered in the technical notes (https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn.htm). Researchers requiring data extraction can utilize the various data access tools (https://www.bls.gov/ces/data/home.htm), while answers to common technical questions can be found in the FAQ section (https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesfaq.htm). Monthly releases and analytical publications are available through the publications page (https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/), providing the most current economic indicators derived from this survey."
